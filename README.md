# TMDbFileUtils
A library to help enumerate both movie files and directories containing TV show seasons and the run them through the [TMBb API](https://www.themoviedb.org). This is going to be used in a larget project in the future.
As for now this library doesn't provide asynchronous methods but will do in the future.

Many thanks to the [TMdbEasy](https://github.com/tonykaralis/TMdbEasy) library of which this project is depending on.
**NOTE:** This doesn't compile yet as I'm waiting a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) package update.
